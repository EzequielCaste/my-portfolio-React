                Hi! üñê My name is Ezequiel. I've been learning JavaScript for a
                couple of years and when I found out that Scrimba was having a
                JavaScriptmas Advent Calendar I signed up right away.
              </p>
              <p>
                Challenges are a great way to flex that coding muscle and learn
                some new methods you were not familiar with.
              </p>
